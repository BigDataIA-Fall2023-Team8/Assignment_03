            "\n",
            "Commission representatives have statutory authority to conduct, at any time or from time to time, reasonable periodic, special, and other examinations of the records of specified Commission-regulated entities (entity or entities). The staff carries out these responsibilities in 11 regional offices and headquarters in Washington, DC. EXAMS' mission is to protect investors, ensure market integrity, and support responsible capital formation through risk-focused strategies that: improve compliance, prevent fraud, monitor risk, and inform policy.\n",
            "\n",
            "During examinations, the staff will seek to determine whether the entity being examined is: conducting its activities in accordance with the federal securities laws and the rules adopted under these laws (as well as, where applicable, the rules of self-regulatory organizations subject to the Commission's oversight); adhering to the disclosures it has made to its clients, customers, the general public, and/or the Commission; and implementing supervisory systems and/or compliance policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the entity's operations are in compliance with applicable legal requirements.\n",
            "\n",
            "The staff appreciates each entity's cooperation as it will facilitate the staff's ability to timely complete the examination. Entities should work promptly to provide the staff with complete and accurate information and ensure that knowledgeable employees are made available to help the staff better understand the entity and its operations.\n",
            "\n",
            "**II.****THE EXAMINATION PROCESS**\n",
            "\n",
            "The Commission's examination program is risk-based. An entity may be selected for examination for any number of reasons including, but not limited to, a statutory mandate that requires the Commission to examine the entity; the entity's risk profile; a tip, complaint, or referral; or a review of a particular compliance risk area. The reason an entity has been selectedfor examination is non-public information and typically will not be shared with the entity under examination. As part of the pre-examination planning process, the staff strives to efficiently allocate resources and minimize, if possible, any overlap with the scope of any recent or ongoing examinations or investigations by other regulators or Commission staff in other Commission offices or divisions. If an entity has any concerns with respect to overlapping examinations or investigations, the entity should contact the Commission staff involved.\n",
            "\n",
            "Throughout the examination process, the staff may consult and/or coordinate with other Commission staff, including supervisory examination staff and staff in other Commission offices and divisions, regarding any issues identified and the interpretation and application of the securities laws and rules adopted under these laws, and, as applicable, self-regulatory organization rules. As a result, the staff may share information and documents received from the entity with other Commission staff to the extent the staff deems necessary or appropriate. The Commission may also share information and documents with other regulators or authorities. Whether the Commission has shared information and documents received from an entity is a confidential matter. These and other possible uses of information and documents provided to the staff are described in the Commission's Form 1661, which is provided to entities at the outset of an examination and may be accessed at www.sec.gov/files/sec1661.pdf. The staff does not accept limitations on these routine uses. Similarly, when an entity or its service provider requires acceptance of terms and conditions to access websites, applications, or other systems that contain the entity's books and records, any action taken by the staff purportedly agreeing to such terms and conditions, including clicking an \"accept\" button, will not constitute an acceptance of the terms or conditions and will not bind the staff or the Commission in contract.\n",
            "\n",
            "Examinations may be conducted on an announced or unannounced basis. When the examination is announced, the staff typically phones the entity's Chief Compliance Officer or regulatory personnel and follows up with a letter notifying the entity of the examination and requesting information, including documents, that the staff will review as part of the examination. These information requests are generally transmitted through secure email. Information regarding data delivery and the use of secure email and file transfer are available at www.sec.gov/exams. While the staff cannot comment on the specific safeguards that the Commission takes to protect non-public information, the protection of non-public information, including documents and information provided by entities during examinations, is of the utmost importance to EXAMS. When the examination is unannounced, the staff may provide the entity with a request for information, including documents, upon arrival and may conduct an initial interview. In most instances, the staff will request that information and documents be provided in electronic format via secure transmission by a specified date. For any records that cannot be produced in electronic format, the entity should promptly make such records available for examination in another manner.

The range for awards is between 10% and 30% of the monetary sanctions collected in the Commission action or in a related action upon which the award is based. A \"whistleblower\" is an individual who voluntarily provides original information in writing to the Commission about a possible violation of the federal securities laws that has occurred, is ongoing, or is about to occur. To be eligible for an award based on any information provided by the whistleblower that relates to a possible violation of the federal securities laws, the whistleblower must comply with the procedures and the conditions described in Rule 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. One of those procedures, among others, specifies that a whistleblower must provide the information to the Commission on Form TCR or through the Commission's online TCR portal and sign the required declaration. One of the conditions, among others, is that the whistleblower' submission must be voluntary. Information is provided \"voluntarily\" if it is provided before a request, inquiry, or demand that relates to the subject matter of the submission is directed to the whistleblower or a representative (i) by the Commission; (ii) in connection with an investigation, inspection, or examination by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or any self-regulatory organization; or (iii) in connection with an investigation by the Congress, any other authority of the federal government, or a state Attorney General or securities regulatory authority. A whistleblower must be an individual, providing information alone or jointly with others. A company or other entity cannot be a whistleblower. A person is not required to be an employee of an entity to submit information about that entity.\n",

An entity may be selected for examination for any number of reasons including, but not limited to, a statutory mandate that requires the Commission to examine the entity; the entity's risk profile; a tip, complaint, or referral; or a review of a particular compliance risk area. The reason an entity has been selectedfor examination is non-public information and typically will not be shared with the entity under examination. As part of the pre-examination planning process, the staff strives to efficiently allocate resources and minimize, if possible, any overlap with the scope of any recent or ongoing examinations or investigations by other regulators or Commission staff in other Commission offices or divisions. If an entity has any concerns with respect to overlapping examinations or investigations, the entity should contact the Commission staff involved.\n",

As a result, the staff may share information and documents received from the entity with other Commission staff to the extent the staff deems necessary or appropriate. The Commission may also share information and documents with other regulators or authorities. Whether the Commission has shared information and documents received from an entity is a confidential matter. These and other possible uses of information and documents provided to the staff are described in the Commission's Form 1661, which is provided to entities at the outset of an examination and may be accessed at www.sec.gov/files/sec1661.pdf. The staff does not accept limitations on these routine uses. Similarly, when an entity or its service provider requires acceptance of terms and conditions to access websites, applications, or other systems that contain the entity's books and records, any action taken by the staff purportedly agreeing to such terms and conditions, including clicking an \"accept\" button, will not constitute an acceptance of the terms or conditions and will not bind the staff or the Commission in contract.\n",
            "Examinations may be conducted on an announced or unannounced basis. When the examination is announced, the staff typically phones the entity's Chief Compliance Officer or regulatory personnel and follows up with a letter notifying the entity of the examination and requesting information, including documents, that the staff will review as part of the examination. These information requests are generally transmitted through secure email. Information regarding data delivery and the use of secure email and file transfer are available at www.sec.gov/exams. While the staff cannot comment on the specific safeguards that the Commission takes to protect non-public information, the protection of non-public information, including documents and information provided by entities during examinations, is of the utmost importance to EXAMS. When the examination is unannounced, the staff may provide the entity with a request for information, including documents, upon arrival and may conduct an initial interview. In most instances, the staff will request that information and documents be provided in electronic format via secure transmission by a specified date. For any records that cannot be produced in electronic format, the entity should promptly make such records available for examination in another manner. The Commission expects that in most circumstances records should be available to staff within 24 hours; however, the staff typically provides a longer period of time to produce records.
